The elderly citizens hold the aggregate wisdom of our community through their lifeâ€™s experiences. However, as they grow old, they are being increasingly confronted with social isolation and loneliness causing irreparable harm to their well-being (Waycott, 2022). Hence, it is now more than ever our collective responsibility to alleviate their suffering and provide them with the best comfort that they truly deserve.

One in every 6 Australians are aged (over 65 years and above) and one-third of them are living alone which makes them vulnerable to facing social isolation ("Older people Overview - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare", 2022). As these statistical figures continue to swell, the aged population are increasingly facing physical and mental health issues. Currently, there is no online portal or mobile application which fully addresses the needs of the elderly by offering them a unified solution to enhance their quality of life. Our team, the WYNDS, now aims to develop an integrated digital solution in the form of a web portal, which would be very user-friendly and simple to use, in order to accomplish this objective.

The team plans to develop a website that will allow its users to chat with other users through their profiles or as a guest, create and search for social group activities in proximity to their location and search for aged-care homes that adequately meets their requirements. It is also envisioned to incorporate a search option which would list out the government benefits entitled to an aged person, along with an AI enabled chatbot to provide any informative support. Agile methodology will be adopted to develop the project in iterations with features to be rolled out in continuous integration and continuous deployment mode.
